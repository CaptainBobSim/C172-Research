EMERGENCY LOCATOR TRANSMITTER {ELT)
A remote switch/annunciator is installed on the top center
location of the copilot's instrument panel for control of the EL T from
the flight crew station. The annunciator, which is in the center of
the rocker switch, illuminates when the EL T transmitter is
transmitting. The EL T emits an omni-directional signal on the
international distress frequencies of 121.5 MHz and 243.0 MHz.
General aviation and commercial aircraft, the FAA and CAP monitor
121.5 MHz, and 243.0 MHz is monitored by the military. For a
basic overview of the EL T, refer to the Supplements, Section 9.
